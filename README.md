# Angular Material Learning Sandbox

This project is a sandbox environment for learning and experimenting with Angular Material components.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Angular Material

This project is pre-configured with Angular Material. You can find the official documentation and examples at [material.angular.io](https://material.angular.io/).

To add a new Material component, you'll typically:
1. Import the component's module into your Angular module (e.g., `app.module.ts` or a specific feature module).
2. Use the component's selector in your HTML templates.

## Exploring Components

The main application component is located in `src/app/`. You can modify `app.html` and `app.ts` to add and test different Angular Material components.

## Additional Angular Resources
